    <h1>About UnscriptedAdventures</h1>
    <div class="about-container">
        <p>Welcome to <strong>UnscriptedAdventures</strong>, a unique text-based RPG experience where the story unfolds based on your choices and interactions. Our game is inspired by the timeless and engaging elements of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), providing an immersive adventure that brings together creativity, strategy, and storytelling.</p>

        <p>At UnscriptedAdventures, players interact with a dynamic Dungeon Master (DM) and various Non-Player Characters (NPCs), each driven by our advanced Large Language Model (LLM) agents. These agents respond to your decisions, creating a living, breathing world full of possibilities.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to offer a unique platform that combines the rich, narrative-driven gameplay of D&D with cutting-edge AI technology. We aim to provide players with an engaging and personalized role-playing experience where every decision matters and every character has a story to tell.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>To get started, create your character using our <a href="/character_creation">Character Creation</a> page. You can choose from a wide range of races, classes, and backgrounds to build a character that fits your unique style. Then, embark on your adventure and explore the world, interact with NPCs, and shape the story with your choices.</p>
