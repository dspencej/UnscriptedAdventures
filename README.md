# UnscriptedAdventures

UnscriptedAdventures is a text-based RPG game inspired by Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). The game leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents to create a dynamic and immersive experience where players interact with a Dungeon Master (DM) and various Non-Player Characters (NPCs) through a chatbot interface.

## Features

- **Dynamic Storytelling:** A virtual DM driven by an LLM agent guides the story, responding to player choices and actions.
- **Character Creation:** Create and customize your character with various races, classes, and backgrounds.
- **Engaging Interactions:** Communicate with NPCs and make choices that influence the game's storyline and outcome.
- **Reward System:** A unique reward system that evaluates player engagement and adjusts the DM's strategy accordingly.
