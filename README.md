# UnscriptedAdventures

UnscriptedAdventures is a text-based RPG game that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver a dynamic, immersive experience. Players engage with a virtual Game Master (GM) and Non-Player Characters (NPCs) through a chatbot interface, making choices that directly influence the unfolding narrative. The application is built using FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

**Note:** UnscriptedAdventures is currently in Alpha development. Documentation updates are ongoing. The project remains actively developed, and contributions are welcome. If you wish to contribute, please create a Pull Request.
