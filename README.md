# UnscriptedAdventures

UnscriptedAdventures is a text-based RPG game that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents to create a dynamic and immersive experience. Players interact with a virtual Game Master (GM) and various Non-Player Characters (NPCs) through a chatbot interface, making choices that shape the narrative.
